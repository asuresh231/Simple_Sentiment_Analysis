# Simple_Sentiment_Analysis
For this project I've decided to build a simple sentiment analysis model using the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset located at https://www.kaggle.com/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format. I included the test set('test.csv') in this repository, but could not include the train set because it was too large. 

## Dependencies
I have included all dependencies and packages that need to be installed in a 'requirements.txt' file 

### Model Building 
The 'SentimentAnalysisModel.py' file in this repository contains the script used to load, preprocess, train and generate predictions for the IMDB reviews. The 'Main.py' file in this repository runs the 'SentimentAnalysisModel.py' file and generates 'sgd_logit_model.pkl','vectorizer.pkl' as well as the confusion matrix generated from my test set predictions. The confusion matrix is located in the 'cm.jpg' file. The 'sgd_logit_model.pkl' file is the Stochastic Gradient Descent Logistic Regression model I saved using the joblib library to conduct sentiment analysis. The 'vectorizer.pkl' file is my tfidf embedder saved using joblib.



#### Flask Application
To deploy, I decided to create a Flask application. The application is located in the 'flask_app.py' file. This app when run is simply a microservice that takes a review as an argument and returns the probability that the review is positive.
